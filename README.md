# Purpose
Lao doesn't have a lot of font options. There are a couple decent fonts for general text that are open source/open licesned. There are some old fonts that aren't very modern, but do the job. But, there aren't many Lao display fonts, especially those designed to make headers and larger text more appealing for young people. This font is an attempt to change that.

# Inspiration
There's a sign for a waterfall in Luang Prabang, called Kouang Si Waterfall. Here is an example of the sign:

# History
This is my first attempt to create a font. I love open source, and I thought this might be a good way to contribute and help the Lao people. It started as a need for a better font for headers in kid-friendly materials. But why make something for myself and not share it with others?

# Work in Progress
It's certainly not the prettiest. Certainly not the most demanding. It won't fold your laundry, or cook your food. If it makes a kid enjoy reading a little more, then it has served its purpose! But that doesn't mean it needs to stay stagnant. If you want to improve upon it, feel free to contribute, modify it, or use it as a template to create something great!
